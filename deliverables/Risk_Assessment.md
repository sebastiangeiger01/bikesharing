### Risk Assessment

In the section that now follows, we consider the risks that may be associated with our project. The risks are presented in a risk matrix and explained subsequently.

## Risk 1: Time management
At first, we established a set timetable using our MVG approach. This initiative aimed to provide a product with the least amount of work possible. The buyer can afterwards add all other extensions. As a result, the idea of "time management" is neither highly probable nor highly impactful.

## Risk 2: Software architecture errors
Numerous different open-source software programs may have a wide range of errors. No matter if it's due to different operating systems or outdated hardware that doesn't support anything. These issues kept coming up and made it such that there was less time available for the project.

## Risk 3: Errors in the program code
Although every effort has been made to program as precisely as precisely as possible, programming errors can still occur quickly, causing the software to crash or display errors. Such errors typically take a lot of time to discover and need a keen eye for detail.

## Risk 4: Lack of know-how
There are significant knowledge gaps because of the mixed project group. Whether it is in the front end or the back end. It has taken a lot of time to develop the necessary skills because of the lack of knowledge.
