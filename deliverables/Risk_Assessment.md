### Risk Assessment

In the section that now follows, we consider the risks that may be associated with our project. The risks are presented in a risk matrix and explained subsequently.

## Risk 1: Time management
Not all features can be implemented because of the time limit. These may, however, be quickly put into practice subsequently. The main objective was to produce a workable product that could be later enhanced and expanded. Time management here also includes the fact that team members work at different times and therefore coordination of cooperation is more difficult.

## Risk 2: Software architecture errors
Numerous different open-source software programs may have a wide range of errors. No matter if it's due to different operating systems or outdated hardware that doesn't support anything. These issues kept coming up and made it such that there was less time available for the project. Because not all members' software and hardware are equally modern, problems like these did exist with united members.

## Risk 3: Errors in the program code
Although every effort has been made to program as precisely as possible, programming errors can still occur quickly, causing the software to crash or display errors. Such errors typically take a lot of time to discover and need a keen eye for detail.

## Risk 4: Lack of know-how
There are significant knowledge gaps because of the mixed project group. Whether it is in the front end or the back end. It has taken a lot of time to develop the necessary skills because of the lack of knowledge. This point also varies from person to person.
