### GitLab

GitLab is a crucial part of our project environment. It is a web-based, open-source version control application that is freely available under the community license. Projects are organized into digital archives called repositories, which contain all project files and programming code. Team members can download a copy of the repository to their local computers, make changes, and then upload them back to the repository for review by other team members. Changes are published after they are reviewed and approved through a process called committing. GitLab's branching feature allows programmers to easily create unique branches that diverge from the main development stream. This allows everyone involved in the project to work on a new feature without changing the main. We used GitLab as a central repository for the program code, documentation, and other key elements in our project. It is centered on our master. You may find all recently tested versions in the master. To safeguard this version and avoid unintentional deletions, our master is secured. Different additional repositories that were built from the master are available to each team member. so that everyone might utilize the most recent version. Features are divided up into several repositories. As a result, every team member is able to push their feature branch and generate a merge request for the protected branch. Before merging, code is examined and history is protected.


### Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop, a tool for Windows and macOS, makes it easy to design, test, and deploy your project using container technology. It includes the Docker engine, which powers the containers, and provides a user-friendly interface for managing them. Containerization of your application is made simple with Docker Desktop, ensuring consistency and repeatability between development and production environments. In our instance, we divided the program into several containers using Docker. In this manner, you could constantly leave the containers and summon them from wherever you were working. To administer them, they divided the various containers into the WebApp, our database, and the Adminer.


### Zoom

Zoom is a platform for online meetings and video conferencing that enables people to interact and work together at a distance. It is accessible for desktop and mobile devices and includes capabilities like screen sharing, virtual backdrops, and recording. It is frequently used for distance learning, online jobs, and virtual gatherings. We used zoom as an online conference to hold our meetings.
