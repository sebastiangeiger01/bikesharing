### GitLab

GitLab is a crucial part of our project environment. It is a web-based, open-source version control application that is freely available under the community license. Projects are organized into digital archives called repositories, which contain all project files and programming code. Team members can download a copy of the repository to their local computers, make changes, and then upload them back to the repository for review by other team members. Changes are published after they are reviewed and approved through a process called committing. GitLab's branching feature allows programmers to easily create unique branches that diverge from the main development stream. This allows everyone involved in the project to work on a new feature without changing the main.


### Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop, a tool for Windows and macOS, makes it easy to design, test, and deploy your project using container technology. It includes the Docker engine, which powers the containers, and provides a user-friendly interface for managing them. Containerization of your application is made simple with Docker Desktop, ensuring consistency and repeatability between development and production environments.
