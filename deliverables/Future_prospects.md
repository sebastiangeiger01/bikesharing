### Future prospects

Currently, our product is sufficient to address the core issue with our customers. There are yet more schemes and ideas that might result in sin in this situation. The increase in security would be one aspect. One possibility is the use of multi-factor authentication. The user must first present two or more forms of identification before they may access our product. A password, security token, or biometric feature like a fingerprint or facial recognition system can be used as these identitiy types. Unauthorized persons should find it more difficult to get important information as a result. Additionally, the resetting of the password or email has not yet been implemented. Once there is no longer any access to the password or email, a new account must be created. An SSL connection is yet another quick method to increase security. The exchanged data is encrypted and decrypted at this location using a distinct session key. This makes sure that important information cannot be intercepted and read by unauthorized parties during transmission. A native mobile application is another crucial element. Our product may currently only be accessed through the website. While it is technically possible with a smartphone, the device was not designed for it. This ensures that an app's usability and user experience (UX) are kept to the highest standards. There are tools available to help developers with websites, so they don't have to design an entirely new app. One option would be to convert the product into an app using "appmysite." No programming is required for this; instead, it connects to the website, allows for further configuration, tests it, and then publishes it. The next step still lacks the bicycle booking features for specific data. An additional calendar must be implemented here. With the use of this feature, users may select any day and reserve one of our bikes in advance. A last opportunity must be provided for this process to be completed with a payment. The easiest place to make a PayPal booking is here. As a result, one need not provide a payment method for an account.
