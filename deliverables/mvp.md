### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The MVG model was used for this project. The goal of a Minimum Viable Product is to gather as much information about a product with minimal effort. The challenge is determining what constitutes the "minimum" while still ensuring the product is "viable," or useful, and provides value to clients. This model was chosen because it can be easily adopted by a small shooting club near Hanau after completion. It was estimated that the implementation would require 50 hours, which were divided into:

- Initial set-up of the project - 2 hours 
- Finding the appropriate services - 3 hours 
- Implementation of the backend - 25 hours 
- Implementation of the frontend - 15 hours 
- The documentation - 5 hours
