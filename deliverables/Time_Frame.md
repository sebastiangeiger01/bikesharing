### Time Frame


The first step in our project was "theme identification" where ideas for a common project topic were gathered and chosen. This led to the milestone "topic identification" being achieved. Next, we moved on to the "Project description" work package. In this package, we covered basic information about the project including the team members and their roles, the product vision, a preliminary understanding of the software requirements and architecture, and the projected timeline. The milestone for this work package was "Completion of the Project Description." With the rough overview obtained from the previous work package, we were able to begin the work package "Create the Software Requirements" which included creating personas, scenarios, and user stories. Upon completion of the "Completion of Software Requirements" milestone, this work package was finished. After completing the previous work package, we moved on to the "Creation of the software architecture" work package. In this stage, we developed and described the software architecture. The milestone for this work package was "Completion of the Software Architecture." Simultaneously, we also began the "production of the programming code" and "production of the project documentation" work packages. These two work packages were divided into frontend, backend, and project management tasks, and project documentation was also written in each of these areas. Once the project documentation and code were completed, both work packages were finished. The project was completed by finishing the project documentation.

Through our Gantt chart you can easily see that we have not worked through our project step by step, but many processes were divided in parallel.
