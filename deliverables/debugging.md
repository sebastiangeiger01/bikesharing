# Debugging
Debugging is the process of identifying and resolving errors or bugs in a computer program. It involves analyzing the program's code, looking for the root cause of the problem, and making changes to the code to fix the issue. Debugging can be done using a variety of tools and techniques, such as breakpoints, step-by-step execution, and print statements. Debugging can be a time-consuming process, but it is essential for ensuring that a program is functioning correctly and efficiently.
