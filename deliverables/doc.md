## app.py
This is a Flask web application that provides functionality for managing a bike-sharing service. Here is a brief overview of the code:
* The from statements at the top import the necessary modules for the application.
* The app = create_app() line creates an instance of the Flask app by calling the create_app() function from the create_app.py file in the same directory as this file.
* The next block of code sets up Flask-Security, a Flask extension that adds authentication and authorization features to the application. It does this by creating a user datastore using a SQLAlchemy session and the User and Role models from the models.py file.
* The setup_roles() function, which is called before the first request is handled, creates default roles and a default admin user if no roles or users exist in the database.
* The home() function is a Flask route that returns the home.html template, along with a GeoJSON string that contains information about all the bikes in the system.
* The hello() and biketest() routes are placeholders that can be removed later. They are included here for testing purposes.
* The bikes() route returns a JSON list of all the bikes in the system.
* The users() route returns a JSON list of all the users in the system. It is protected by the @roles_required decorator, which means that only users with the 'user-manager' role can access it.
* The bike(id) route is used for renting and returning bikes. It accepts both GET and POST requests. If the request is a GET request, the route returns the bike.html template along with information about the bike with the specified id. If the request is a POST or PUT request, the route handles renting or returning the bike, depending on the current state of the bike.
Overall, this code provides the necessary functionality for a basic bike-sharing service. It allows users to view and rent bikes, and provides an administrative interface for managing users and bikes.

## __init__.py
This is a Flask application factory, which is a function that creates and configures a Flask app instance. Here is a brief overview of the code:
* The import statements at the top import the necessary modules for the application.
* The csrf and mail objects are instances of the CSRFProtect and Mail classes, respectively. These are Flask extensions that add CSRF protection and email support to the application.
* The create_app() function is the application factory. It creates a Flask app instance and configures it with the necessary settings. These settings include the database connection URI, secret key, password salt, email server settings, and other options.
* The function initializes the csrf and mail objects with the Flask app instance, and creates the database tables using the db object. Finally, it returns the Flask app instance.
Overall, this code provides a way to create and configure a Flask app instance with the necessary settings for a web application. This can be useful for organizing the code for a Flask app and separating the application logic from the configuration.

## models.py
This code defines several SQLAlchemy models that represent the data stored in a database. Here is a brief overview of the models:
* The RolesUsers model represents the relationship between users and roles. It has fields for the id, user_id, and role_id, which are the primary key, the id of the user, and the id of the role, respectively.
* The Role model represents a role that a user can have. It has fields for the id, name, description, and permissions of the role.
* The User model represents a user of the application. It has fields for the user's id, email, username, password, and other information such as login timestamps, IP addresses, and login count. It also has a roles relationship that specifies the roles that the user has.
* The Bike model represents a bike in the bike-sharing service. It has fields for the id, name, x_coordinate, and y_coordinate of the bike.
* The Ride model represents a ride that a user takes on a bike. It has fields for the id, user_id, bike_id, start_time, and end_time of the ride.
Overall, these models provide the necessary data structure for a bike-sharing service. They define the relationships between users, roles, bikes, and rides, and can be used to store and retrieve information from the database.

## database.py
This code defines a set of utility functions that can be used to perform common database operations, such as querying, creating, updating, and deleting data. Here is a brief overview of the functions:
* The get_all(model) function returns a list of all the instances of a given model.
* The get_instance(model, id) function returns a single instance of a model with the specified id.
* The add_instance(model, **kwargs) function creates a new instance of a model and adds it to the database. It takes the model class and the field values for the new instance as keyword arguments.
* The delete_instance(model, id) function deletes a single instance of a model with the specified id.
* The edit_instance(model, id, **kwargs) function updates the field values of an existing instance of a model. It takes the model class, the id of the instance to update, and the new field values as keyword arguments.
* The commit_changes() function commits the changes made to the database.
Overall, these utility functions provide a convenient way to perform common database operations in the application. They can be used to query, create, update, and delete data in the database, and simplify the code for working with the database.

## db_config.py
This code defines a string that specifies the connection URI for a PostgreSQL database. The connection URI contains the necessary information for connecting to the database, such as the user, password, host, port, and database name.
The connection URI is constructed by concatenating the values of several environment variables using string formatting. These environment variables must be set with the correct values for the user, password, host, port, and database name, in order for the connection URI to be valid.
The DATABASE_CONNECTION_URI constant can be used to specify the database connection URI in the Flask app configuration, and connect to the database in the application.

## Dockerfile
This code defines a Dockerfile that can be used to build a Docker image for a Flask application. The Dockerfile specifies the instructions for building the image, including setting the working directory, environment variables, copying files, and running commands.
Here is a brief overview of the instructions in the Dockerfile:
1. The FROM instruction specifies the base image that the Docker image is built on. In this case, the base image is python, which is the official Python image from Docker Hub.
2. The WORKDIR instruction sets the working directory for the image. In this case, it sets the working directory to /code, which is the directory where the application code is stored.
3. The ENV instruction sets environment variables that can be used in the image. In this case, it sets the FLASK_APP and FLASK_RUN_HOST environment variables, which are used by the Flask command-line interface to run the application.
4. The COPY instruction copies files from the host file system into the image. In this case, it copies the requirements.txt file, which specifies the dependencies of the application, into the image.
5. The RUN instruction runs a command in the image. In this case, it runs pip to install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file.
6. The EXPOSE instruction specifies the ports that are exposed by the Docker image. In this case, the EXPOSE instruction exposes port 5000, which is the default port that Flask uses to run the application.
7. The second COPY instruction copies the application code from the host file system into the image.
8. The CMD instruction specifies the command that is run when the Docker image is started. In this case, it runs the Flask command-line interface to start the application.
Overall, this Dockerfile provides a set of instructions for building a Docker image for a Flask application. The image can be used to run the application in a container, and can be easily deployed to a server or cloud platform.

## requirements.txt
Sure, a requirements.txt file is used to specify the dependencies of a Python application. It lists the Python packages that the application depends on, and their version numbers.
The purpose of the requirements.txt file is to provide a list of the packages that are required to run the application. This list can be used to install the dependencies automatically using the pip command. For example, the following command installs the dependencies from a requirements.txt file:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Having a requirements.txt file is useful for several reasons:
* It makes it easy to install the dependencies for the application.
* It ensures that the application has all the necessary dependencies, and that they are installed in the correct versions.
* It allows others to quickly set up the same environment that the application was developed in.
* It helps with reproducibility and consistency of the application, since the dependencies are specified in a single file.

The requirements.txt file lists the following dependencies:
* flask: The Flask web framework, which is used to build the application.
* psycopg2: The psycopg2 package, which is used to connect to a PostgreSQL database.
* flask-security-too[fsqla, common, mfa]: Flask-Security-Too is a Flask extension that provides security and authentication features for Flask applications, including user registration, login, logout, password management, and more.
* flask-sqlalchemy: Flask-SQLAlchemy is a Flask extension that provides a simple interface for interacting with a database using the SQLAlchemy library, which is a powerful Python library for interacting with databases. It allows you to easily query, update, and delete records in a database, as well as create, modify, and delete tables.
* flask_mailman: The Flask-Mailman package, which provides support for sending email with Flask.
These dependencies are required by the application in order to run properly. By specifying them in the requirements.txt file, they can be easily installed with the pip command. This ensures that the application has all the necessary dependencies, and that they are installed in the correct versions.

## docker-compose.yml
The docker-compose.yml file is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. The file defines several services, which are run in separate Docker containers. Each service is defined with a name, an image, and a set of optional configuration options.
The file defines three services:
* webapp: This service runs the Flask application in a Docker container. The image option specifies the name of the Docker image that is used to build the container, and the build option specifies the path to the directory containing the Dockerfile for the image. The restart option specifies that the container should be restarted automatically if it exits or crashes. The env_file option specifies the paths to the environment files that contain the configuration for the application. The ports option maps port 80 on the host machine to port 5000 in the container, where the Flask application is running. The depends_on option specifies that the webapp service depends on the database service.
* database: This service runs a PostgreSQL database in a Docker container. The image option specifies the name of the Docker image that is used to build the container, which in this case is the postgres image from Docker Hub. The restart option specifies that the container should be restarted automatically if it exits or crashes. The volumes option mounts a named Docker volume at /var/lib/postgresql/data, which is where the PostgreSQL data files are stored. The env_file option specifies the path to the environment file that contains the configuration for the database.
* adminer: This service runs an Adminer instance in a Docker container. Adminer is a tool for managing databases, including MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more. It provides a web-based interface for performing database tasks such as creating, modifying, and deleting tables, as well as executing SQL queries and managing users and permissions. The image option specifies the name of the Docker image that is used to build the container, which in this case is the adminer image from Docker Hub. The restart option specifies that the container should be restarted automatically if it exits or crashes. The ports option maps port 8080 on the host machine to port 8080 in the container, where the Adminer instance is running.

The file also defines a named Docker volume called postgres_volume, which is used by the database service. This volume allows data to persist between runs of the database container, so that the data is not lost if the container is stopped or restarted.
To run the application, you can use the docker-compose command to build and start the containers, as follows:

```sh
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
Or with one command:
```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

This will build the Docker images for the webapp and database services, using the Dockerfiles and other files in the webapp and database directories. It will then start the containers for each of the services, and connect them so that they can communicate with each other.
Once the containers are running, you should be able to access the Flask application in a web browser at http://localhost, and the Adminer instance at http://localhost:8080.

## database.conf
This is an environment file that contains configuration settings for the PostgreSQL database. The file defines several environment variables that are used to configure the database connection.
The environment variables are as follows:
* POSTGRES_USER: This variable specifies the username that is used to connect to the database.
* POSTGRES_PASSWORD: This variable specifies the password that is used to connect to the database.
* POSTGRES_HOST: This variable specifies the hostname or IP address of the database server.
* POSTGRES_PORT: This variable specifies the port number that is used to connect to the database.
* POSTGRES_DB: This variable specifies the name of the database to connect to.
These environment variables are used by the Flask application and the PostgreSQL container to establish a connection to the database. For example, the Flask application uses these variables to construct a connection URI that specifies the database server, port, and authentication credentials. The PostgreSQL container uses these variables to initialize the database when it is started for the first time.

## mail.conf
This is an environment file that contains configuration settings for the email server that is used to send messages from the Flask application. The file defines several environment variables that are used to configure the email server.
The environment variables are as follows:
* MAIL_SERVER: This variable specifies the hostname or IP address of the email server.
* MAIL_PORT: This variable specifies the port number that is used to connect to the email server.
* MAIL_USE_TLS: This variable specifies whether to use Transport Layer Security (TLS) when connecting to the email server.
* MAIL_USERNAME: This variable specifies the username that is used to authenticate with the email server.
* MAIL_PASSWORD: This variable specifies the password that is used to authenticate with the email server.
* SECURITY_EMAIL_SENDER: This variable specifies the email address that should be used as the sender of messages sent by the Flask application.
These environment variables are used by the Flask application to configure the email server that it uses to send messages. For example, the Flask application uses these variables to specify the hostname, port, authentication credentials, and sender address for the email server. This allows the Flask application to send emails, such as password reset emails, to users of the application.

## security.conf
This is an environment file that contains configuration settings for the Flask-Security-Too module, which is used to implement user authentication and authorization in the Flask application. The file defines two environment variables that are used to configure Flask-Security.
The environment variables are as follows:
* SECRET_KEY: This variable specifies a secret key that is used to secure the Flask application's session data. The session data is encrypted using this key, which helps to prevent session hijacking attacks.
* SECURITY_PASSWORD_SALT: This variable specifies a password salt that is used to hash and salt user passwords. The password salt is used to add additional entropy to the password hashing process, which helps to make it more difficult to crack hashed passwords.
These environment variables are used by the Flask application to configure the Flask-Security module. For example, the Flask application uses these variables to securely store session data and to securely hash user passwords. This helps to protect the security and integrity of user data in the Flask application.
