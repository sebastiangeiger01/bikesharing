### Time Frame

This project is an assignment for the "Software Engineering" module and not a business project, therefore there are no costs associated with it. Only open-source software was used. However, it should be noted that the final product will be given to the customer for further development. We will briefly consider the potential costs associated with this. This was determined using a 20 euro hourly rate. Therefore, we don't include any additional expenses like hardware, power, or taxes. In addition, based on our paperwork, we approximated the hours. These are simply to be interpreted as an approximate value.


| Description  | Working hours | Cost per hours | Total costs |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| Initial set-up of the project  | 4 hours  | 20 euros | 80 euros |
| Finding the appropriate services  | 6 hours | 20 euros | 120 euros |
| Implementation of the backend  | 60 hours | 20 euros | 1200 euros |
| Implementation of the frontend  | 40 hours | 20 euros | 800 euros |
| The documentation  | 20 hours | 20 Euro | 400 euros |



The costs associated with hosting the product on the Microsoft Azure Cloud are another factor. These cost 3.45 euros a day at the moment. This indicates that the price for a month with 30 days on the Azure Cloud is 103.50 euros. However, if there are more calls to the site, the pricing may also change significantly. As a result, the cost is roughly and theoretically equal to 2703.50 euros.
