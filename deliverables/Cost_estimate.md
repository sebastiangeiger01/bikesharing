### Time Frame

This project is an assignment for the "Software Engineering" module and not a business project, therefore there are no costs associated with it. Only open-source software was used. However, it should be noted that the final product will be given to the customer for further development. We will briefly consider the potential costs associated with this. We will estimate the cost based on the time spent on development and documentation, assuming a total of 50 hours at a rate of 20 euros per hour.

Teil mit den Kosten f√ºr die Cloud fehlen und auch das mit dem Verein.
